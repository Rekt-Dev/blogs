        <h1>How companies use your data and how it affects on business industries</h1>
        <div class="blogcontent">
            <p>We are here to talk about Data, how it affects on today's business
                as you know the future is of digital business so IT industries are growing up day by day
                you thing you are using social medias, or many things on the internet free of cost but do you know why they are giving you free access?
                Do you know? Data is most valuable thing for the companies but why?
                the biggest question is your data how affects on business industries?
                so lets start talking about every question.
                the very common question is why companies are giving you free access for surfing their sites and services?
                let me clear you
                nothing is free in the world
                now you ask but how these services and social medias are free they don't charge you anything
                but the answer is no they are charging you.
                do you know you are giving them something more valuable than money?
                what is that?
                answer is time.
                yes your time is more valuable than money.
                now the question is what they do of your time?
                when you spend your time on any website or any social media app, you see ads, same like TV ads,
                you don't even believe that the main source of earning of most social media companies is Advertisements and Sponsorship. 
                we will talk about this topic in the next blog.
                the second thing you are giving them your data now you think what will they do of your data?
                companies analyse your data and find out the interests of their audiences and categorize them into many interests. How they find out your interests?
                lets understand with an example
                if you are a instagram user
                you follow the people by your interest and your mindset.
                and even what you searches daily all things can be analyze.
                you have seen that when you searches about anything in the flipkart then you see ads of same type on your social media these are target ads. This is the main example of data analyzing.
                and now we talk about how Data is most valuable thing for companies
                so as you know by analyzing your data they can make money
                but security of data is also important for companies.
                because if anyone steals data of any company company can face many problems
                now we see
                how you data affects on business industries?
                as you know companies can analyze your data and this data is stored in data centers are in different countries.
                some countries govn can control these data centers legally.
                china govn can analyse data of all data centers in their country this is in their law.
                when they know about your intrests and what you want. They make same products as you want in cheaper options. That is the reason in India most of people uses chinese products because they are cheap and same type of what people want.
                you never thought about this but this is true.
